1. Student Portal: 
         -> This is Java based application. The application provides interaction among students and 
           teachers.
         -> On this application teachers upload student marks of various subjects and also students can
           submit their feedbacks to the scores and request for rechecking also.
         -> Proper functionalites to all stakeholders and permissions are given based on their roles.
         -> All frontend and backend is on java.

2. Offline Quiz Software: 
         -> This is Java Based project, where all backend and frontend is completed using java.
         -> This provides a platform to take mcq quizzes where teacher/professor upload questions and answers in
           backend and after test completion the software provides marks obtained by all students in a list format.
         -> Marks scheme and question pattern can be alterated by professor.

3. Matrimonial Website:
         -> This is a group project based on database mangement system.
         -> Here we work on mysql and nodejs.
         -> we built static webpages and run over node js servers.
         -> We see huge advancement in this project further in future.

4. Book Recommendation: 
         -> This is our 5th semster course project where we have to make a recmmendation system
            using prolog language. As language was allocated by the professor.
         -> GUI is again made in Java.
         -> Prolog is logic programming language.
         -> Knowledge Base , Inference Engine are parts of prolog.

5. Medical Healhcare App:
         -> Reminder system app.
         -> Perform alarm using intent property and startActivity.
         -> create api key to find nearby hospitals.
         -> maintain log of patients medication.
         -> layout and activity are two important aspects.  
         -> Rest API transfer state of data.

6. Remote Procedure Call: 
         -> Creating APIs are more difficult than creating RPC. Many factors are taken into consideration in the 
            development of RPC.
         -> 5 parts: client, client stub, transport channel, server stub and server.
         -> gRPC is hot topic (language independent) , protocol buffers.

7. Neural Style Transfer: 
         -> uses class of deep learning which is called as CNN;
         -> CNN is process visual information hierarchially in feed-forward manner;
         -> on higher layers of network it studied about more technical advance feature of image;
         -> each layer of it can be considered as a filter;
         -> 4_2 is used as content extractor;
         -> we perform correlation b/w different filter responses to obtain texture information not global arrangement;
         -> these correlation are used as gram matrix.
         -> key: we can separate syle and content of image.
         ->  Max pooling is done to in part to help over-fitting by providing an abstracted form of the representation. 
            As well, it reduces the computational cost by reducing the number of parameters to learn and provides basic translation invariance to the internal representation. 

8. Reinforcement learning on OpenAI games:
         -> Actor critic:
